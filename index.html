                Superman, also known as Clark Kent, is the epitome of heroism in the DC universe. Born on the alien planet Krypton, he was sent to Earth by his parents just before his home planet's destruction. Raised as Clark Kent by the loving Kent family in Smallville, Kansas, he discovered his extraordinary powers under Earth's yellow sun. With superhuman strength, speed, flight, and heat vision, Superman protects humanity as the ultimate symbol of hope and justice. Despite his god-like abilities, he embodies humility and compassion, often prioritizing the safety of others above himself. His alter ego as a mild-mannered reporter at the Daily Planet allows him to blend into society while secretly fighting crime and battling formidable foes like Lex Luthor and General Zod. Superman's unwavering commitment to truth, justice, and the well-being of all makes him a timeless icon of heroism.
